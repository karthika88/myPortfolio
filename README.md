 *  Conducted a time series forcast with ARIMA and FB Prophet
 *  Performed sentimental analysis on news data with NLTK Vader
 *  Combined time series-sentimental analysis with Multivariate Prophet model
### 3. [Dynamic Visualization and Tracking of Covid-19 Spread](https://github.com/karthika88/Dynamic-Visualization-and-Tracking-of-Covid-19-Spread) 
 *  Obtained Covid-19 data using python API
 *  Extracted data from JSON object using pandas
 *  Created interative visualizations with Plotly library
### 4. [Mobile Phone Recommendation System](https://github.com/karthika88/Mobile-Phone-Recommendation-System)
 *  Web scrapping and database creation with BeautifulSoup and Pandas
 *  Text data processing and feature selection using NLTK library and providing
    buying recommendation
### 5. [Global Superstore Dashboard with Power BI](https://github.com/karthika88/Global-Superstore-Dashboard-with-Power-BI-)
 * Designed and analyze global superstore data to show overall sales
   performance
 * Recognized the KPIs and provide actionable insights on sales by category,
subcategory region and segments
### 6. [Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm](https://github.com/karthika88/Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm)
 *  Created the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
 *  The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
    predict the right class accordingly.
### 7. [Prediction using Unsupervised ML](https://github.com/karthika88/Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML) 
 *  From ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
    and represent it visually.
### 8. [Crime Against Women in India](https://github.com/karthika88/Crime-Against-Women-in-India)
 *  Time series plot of different zones to find the trend in crime against women
 *  Visualization and analysis for statewise trend
